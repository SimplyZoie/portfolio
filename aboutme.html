  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <img src="image for webpage.jpg" alt="At My Favorite Place" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
  <p> Hey! I am a 16 year old student and am headed to 11th grade. I just started a YouTube channel a couple months ago and I love being a <br> content creator. Being a content creator requires a lot of time and patience. Not only working by yourself for yourself, <br> but also working with other YouTubers and brands. I am also a dancer, a musical artist, and can act but it is not my favorite. <br> Creating new things allows me to express my own sense of style in videos and day-to-day life. <br> One of my dreams has been to start a blog with various topics, also a location for my audience to interact with me. <br> Hopefully this spot allows me to achieve that dream. <br> My dream careers include: educator, blogger, video influencer, lifestyle vlogger, and photographer. I know that it's a lot but the last 4 go hand in hand. <br> Thanks for stopping by and I look forward to seeing you soon. <br> Love, Simply Zoie </p>

  <h1> Test Blog: GWC Week 3 </h1>
  <p> This week was a very interesting week, it was robotic week. When I think about robots, I think about the movement, the structure, and the purpose. <br> Battle Bots comes to mind, you know the show on ABC every summer. These contestants come together and show off their talent. <br> They spend months, some even years working  on these robots. This is their passion, love, and job. <br> But, every weeek of the program there is a struggle, it might be the group work, the actual assignments, or even leadership. This week was tough because our leader was gone the majority of the week and she holds it all together. Without her, it was semi-chaos. While there were fun times, I had more struggles than ever in one week. <br> I thought I had the semi-dream group this week, but it turns out there is no such thing as a dream group. There is a flaw in every group and I can't find a group with the least amount of flaws. <br> This week there were many flaws. One, our bot wasn't working correctly, two, some people didn't help. Three, I couldn't find my best place, but I think motivation might be best. All in all, the day was good and we finished our project successfully. One more day down, two days and four weeks remaining.
