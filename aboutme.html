  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <img src="image for webpage.jpg" alt="At My Favorite Place" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
  <p> I am a 16 year old student and am headed to 11th grade. I just started a YouTube channel a couple months ago and I love being a <br> content creator. Being a content creator requires a lot of time and patience. Not only working by yourself for yourself, <br> but also working with other YouTubers and brands. I am also a dancer, a musical artist, and can act but it is not my favorite. <br> Creating new things allows me to express my own sense of style in videos and day-to-day life. <br> One of my dreams has been to start a blog with various topics, also a location for my audience to interact with me. <br> Hopefully this spot allows me to achieve that dream. <br> My dream careers include: educator, blogger, lifestyle vlogger, and photographer. I know that it's a lot but the last 4 go hand in hand. <br> Thanks for stopping by and I look forward to seeing you soon. <br> Love, Simply Zoie </p>
