  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p> I am a 16 year old student and am headed to 11th grade. I just started a YouTube channel a couple months ago and I love being a <br> content creator. Being a content creator requires a lot of time and patience. Not only working by yourself for yourself, <br> you also work with other YouTubers and brands. I am also a dancer, a musical artist, and can act but it is not my favorite. <br> Creating new things allows me to express my own sense of style in videos.
