  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <img src="image for webpage.jpg" alt="At My Favorite Place" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
  <p> Hey! I am a 16 year old student and am headed to 11th grade. I just started a YouTube channel a couple months ago and I love being a <br> content creator. Being a content creator requires a lot of time and patience. Not only working by yourself for yourself, <br> but also working with other YouTubers and brands. I am also a dancer, a musical artist, and can act but it is not my favorite. <br> Creating new things allows me to express my own sense of style in videos and day-to-day life. <br> One of my dreams has been to start a blog with various topics, also a location for my audience to interact with me. <br> Hopefully this spot allows me to achieve that dream. <br> My dream careers include: educator, blogger, video influencer, lifestyle vlogger, and photographer. I know that it's a lot but the last 4 go hand in hand. <br> Thanks for stopping by and I look forward to seeing you soon. <br> Love, Simply Zoie </p>

  <h1> Test Blog: GWC Week 3 </h1>
  <p> This week was a very interesting week, it was robotic week. When I think about robots, I think about the movement, the structure, and the purpose. <br> Battle Bots comes to mind, you know the show on ABC every summer. These contestants come together and show off their talent. <br> They spend months, some even years working  on these robots. This is their passion, love, and job. <br> But, every weeek of the program there is a struggle, it might be the group work, the actual assignments, or even leadership. This week was tough because our leader was gone the majority of the week and she holds it all together. Without her, it was semi-chaos. While there were fun times, I had more struggles than ever in one week. <br> I thought I had the semi-dream group this week, but it turns out there is no such thing as a dream group. There is a flaw in every group and I can't find a group with the least amount of flaws. <br> This week there were many flaws. One, our bot wasn't working correctly, two, some people didn't help. Three, I couldn't find my best place, but I think motivation might be best. All in all, the day was good and we finished our project successfully. One more day down, two days and four weeks remaining.</p>

  <h1> Test Blog: GWC Week 3 Continued </h1>
  <p> Okay..... another day has come to an end. So, why not blog about it, not that there is much to write or type. Today, we continued working on robots. <br> Our groups got changed back around and I was pretty cool with my group. I knew what to expect, so my assumption was correct. <br> I decided to do research today, when my help was not needed. So, I researched the websites to make a blog. I came up with a few options and now I just have to go for it.<br> This site isn't bad, but just not what I am looking for. However, we will be learning Java Script and that should solve my issues. <br> I feel like my YouTube channel is going to waste right now, it has been 3 weeks since I uploaded, keep in mind I upload 3 days a week normally. My views are down, viewer retention, heck, everything is down. <br> So, this weekend and next week, I have to edit and upload a bunch of videos for my #loves. <br> If you are a #love, remember I love you and will be back very soon. Back to the camp convo. <br> Our robot didn't work, so our project did not go as planned. We didn't compete in the competition, story of my life, so now we are working on our websites/portfolios. <br> Of course mine is a blog, so that is what I am working on. My blog idea is huge and I need another site to let me accomplish that. Soon, my website will be what I need it to be. Simply Zoie's website is coming soon. So, until next time I will talk to you later. <br> Kisses and hugs, Zoie </p>
